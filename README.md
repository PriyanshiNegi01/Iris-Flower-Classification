# Iris Flower Classification

The dataset contains samples of three different species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species has 50 samples, resulting in a total of 150 samples.

The dataset consists of four features (attributes) measured from each iris flower:

1. Sepal Length (in centimeters) - The length of the sepal, which is the outer part of the flower that protects the bud.
2. Sepal Width (in centimeters) - The width of the sepal, measured at its broadest point.
3. Petal Length (in centimeters) - The length of the petal, which is the colorful leaf-like part of the flower.
4. Petal Width (in centimeters) - The width of the petal, measured at its widest point.

## Tools Used
1. Python programming language
2. Numpy and Pandas for exploratory analysis
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Jupyter notebook as IDE
